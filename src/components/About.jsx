              "I am a passionate developer with a strong focus on building
              modern and responsive web applications. As a cloud enthusiast, I
              love exploring scalable solutions and optimizing performance.
              Problem-solving excites me, and I thrive on tackling challenges
              with creativity and innovation to build unique and efficient
              applications.
              <br></br> <br></br>
              Currently, I am in my third year of pursuing a B.Tech degree from
              SRM University, Ramapuram, Chennai. My academic journey has given
              me a solid foundation in computer science and has further fueled
              my interest in technology. I am a lifelong learner, always
              exploring new technologies and methodologies to expand my skill
              set.
              <br></br> <br></br>I strongly believe in the power of
              collaboration and love connecting with like-minded people who
              share the same passion for technology and development. Whether
              itâ€™s discussing new tools or brainstorming project ideas, I enjoy
              learning from others and contributing to shared goals."
